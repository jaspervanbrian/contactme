          <p>
            Everyone who knows me can be divided into two groups: those who like me and those who still donâ€™t know me. Yes, you read that right! I am the most wonderful person you can find (just kidding). I am <strong>Jasper Martin</strong>, a web developer who aims to bring <em>excellent quality service</em> and <em>wonderful user experience</em> to all people (including you of course).
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that in order to make the world a better place, one must be determined enough to make <em>progress</em> and to take <em>failures as lessons</em>. So with every small step we make, we can literally <em>flourish existing systems</em>, and <em>bring groundbreaking ideas</em> that will help shape the world.
